To streamline collaboration, best practice would be to utilize a virtual environment using Python VENV.

1. In the project directory (C:\...\Air-Ticket-Database\webapp), open SHELL or TERMINAL.

2. Create virtual environment using 'python -m venv venv'
This will create a virtual environment named 'venv'.

In this virtual environment, we can use packages without having to have them installed globally on our systems.

3. Activate the virtual environment by typing 'venv\Scripts\activate.bat' (THIS SYNTAX IS DIFFERENT ON MAC/LINUX)

4. You can verify that you are currently in the virtual environment if the command line starts with '(venv) C:\...\>' or '(venv) ~path~$'

5. Once in the virtual environment, you can install all packages used by the webapp by typing 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

6. To export packages (if you added more), type 'pip freeze' or 'pip freeze > requirements.txt' to output to a file.

7. You can now run the app through the virtual environment. (in the environment, type 'python app.py')

NOTE:
Make sure default PATH is Python 3.3+
NOTE:
Include files you don't want to push in .gitignore (like the vs code auxiliary files)

I am working with Python 3.9x


Highly recommend these venv tutorials to get familiarized
