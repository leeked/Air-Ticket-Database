THINGS TO DO
***

1. Automation of ticket creation:
	i. When creating a flight, automatically create tickets for the flight using a trigger
	ii. Afterwards, automatically update VIEW max_num_tickets with new flight

2. When booking a flight:
	*DONE* i. Create trigger such that it checks if at least 75% has been booked then increase price of relevant tickets by 25%

SIDE NOTE:

Also have to implement "complex constraints"
